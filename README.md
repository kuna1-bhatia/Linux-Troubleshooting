## 📂 Commands Demonstrated

### 🔹 System Monitoring
- `top` – Real-time system resource usage
- `free -h` – Memory usage (RAM & Swap)
- `uptime` – System load and running time

### 🔹 Disk & Filesystem
- `df -h` – Disk space usage
- `mount` – Mounted filesystems

### 🔹 Process Management
- `ps aux` – List all running processes
- `kill <PID>` – Terminate a process
- `kill -9 <PID>` – Force kill process

### 🔹 Logs & Output Handling
